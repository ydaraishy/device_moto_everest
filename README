These are device files for creating a version of Android to target the 3G (UMTS) Xoom tablet, ie., the Motorola MZ601.

For licensing cleanliness, proprietary binaries (vendor RIL, driver blobs, Honeycomb wallpapers) are not included and must be taken from a Honeycomb device. See included scripts for this.
